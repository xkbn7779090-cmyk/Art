        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I’m Jan Tar — an expressive oil painter, musician, and the founder of CSA (Club of Shared Activities), a community platform uniting people through creativity, movement, and presence. Originally from Ukraine and now based in Venlo, Netherlands, I’ve found deep inspiration in nature, human connection, and personal transformation.</p>
        <p>My art goes beyond traditional portraiture. I’ve created over 300 oil paintings, using texture, movement, and trance-like flow to capture raw emotion, inner states, and dynamic energy. Each piece becomes a reflection of life in motion — a way to invite the viewer into direct emotional resonance.</p>
        <p>Beyond the canvas, I’m deeply passionate about bringing people together. I organize community events, art therapy sessions, contact improvisation workshops, and immersive adult creative camps. Through CSA, I facilitate experiences where people can explore, express, and connect — not only with each other, but with their own inner landscapes.</p>
        <p>Diagnosed with ADHD, I’ve embraced a multi-focused lifestyle that thrives on parallel ideas and creative exploration. Whether I’m composing soundscapes with a Rav Vast, developing NFT-based art projects, or curating AI-powered interactive installations, I live at the intersection of analog soul and digital potential.</p>
        <p>I’m especially interested in collaborative projects, and always open to connecting with curators, gallery owners, and fellow artists to co-create meaningful work. My vision is to blend art, music, technology, and human presence into shared experiences that heal, inspire, and awaken.</p>
        <p>Let’s meet where art becomes dialogue, and creativity becomes a bridge between worlds.</p>
        <h2>1992 — Origins</h2>
        <p>I was born in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, during the harsh and uncertain 1990s. My parents named me Alexander. Growing up in post-Soviet collapse taught me to adapt early — to find my own path where structure was either broken or imposed.</p>
        <h2>2005–2007 — Military Discipline, Internal Rejection</h2>
        <p>At the age of 13, I entered the Kyiv Military Lyceum. This experience gave me discipline, endurance, and the ability to survive within rigid systems. But it also made one thing clear: the path of violence and control wasn’t mine. I wasn’t made for war. That realization became one of the most important pivots in my life.</p>
        <h2>2007–2009 — Civilian Return & New Direction</h2>
        <p>After leaving the lyceum, I returned to a regular high school, completed all 11 grades, and passed my state exams. This transition symbolized my shift from imposed structure toward personal freedom. I was ready to take control of my own path — with curiosity and critical thinking as my tools.</p>
        <h2>2009–2013 — Engineering the Logical Mind</h2>
        <p>I enrolled at Zhytomyr State Technological University and completed a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Technology fascinated me — it was logical, structured, and offered a way to build things from scratch. Though I also had interest in law and social systems, programming gave me a foundation in systems thinking and architecture.</p>
        <p>During this time, I explored digital marketing, targeted advertising, and social media strategy. I managed online campaigns and experimented with content flows. Later I stepped away from mainstream platforms — today, I use only Telegram and occasionally WhatsApp, focusing on mindful communication.</p>
        <h2>Late 2013 — First Crypto Spark</h2>
        <p>In late December 2013, I discovered Dogecoin during its very first week after launch — even before I began drawing. I mined over a million coins on my home GPU desktop, and later sold most for around $2000. That was my first experience in the crypto world, planting the seeds for future exploration.</p>
        <h2>2014 — First Contact With Art</h2>
        <p>After a breakup, I met a comic artist who told me: “Just draw. Don’t overthink.” That invitation unlocked something in me. I made my first sketch — raw, honest, expressive — and discovered art as a tool for healing and expression.</p>
        <h2>2015–2021 — Nomadic Healing & Rebuilding Identity</h2>
        <p>I moved to Crimea and embraced a nomadic lifestyle: living in tents, hitchhiking across the land, reconnecting with nature, and healing inner wounds. It was a time of reflection, community, and radical simplicity — a deep reset before rebirth.</p>
        <h2>2022–2025 — Artistic Explosion & Decentralized Thinking</h2>
        <p>Moving to the Netherlands marked a creative breakthrough. I created over 300 oil paintings in three years, channeling emotion, energy, and internal flow. Painting became meditation, therapy, and voice.</p>
        <p>I founded CSA – Club of Shared Activities, a platform for art therapy, musical gatherings, contact improvisation, and adult creative camps. I build spaces where people connect through creativity, movement, and shared presence.</p>
        <p>Now I explore how to merge analog art with blockchain, dive into NFTs, DAO systems, and apply crypto-anarchist principles to collective creativity and sovereignty.</p>
        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing NFT projects linked to physical oil paintings</li>
            <li>Organizing CSA-based community events, exhibitions & retreats</li>
            <li>Exploring AI tools, decentralized structures, and token-based ecosystems</li>
            <li>Living as a crypto-spiritual artist-engineer — a hybrid of raw emotion, digital logic, and collective presence</li>
        </ul>
